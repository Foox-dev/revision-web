# IdleRPG Offline

### Description
An offline version of upcoming online text-based RPG game with elements of Idle Incremental games.
If you want to look into source code, I should say that's my first game, so it's probably useless for anyone else.
Game can be played without internet connection as it uses only self-hosted normalize.css library and Rubik font.

### Usage
Just download it and open index.html file in your browser. Note, that it may not work on older browsers, as it uses ECMAScript2015 classes (Edge 13, Chrome 49, Firefox 45).
You can also put it on server to share it with friends, but this game won't contain any build-in multiplayer features.
JavaScript's variables can be easily changed in browser, so it probably needs to be rewritten into server-side code to prevent cheating.

I use SCSS to make CSS easier to write and to minify result file. If you don't want to use it, just copy content of style.css into any online CSS formatter and replace it.

### License
I don't know which license should I put there, but I'll keep it simple.
You can make your own game based on this, as long as you change enough code to make it look different.
Giving a credit with link to this GitHub page (e.g. Based on Assertrex's IdleRPG Offline) could be nice, but you don't have to do it if you don't want to.
